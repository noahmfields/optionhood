How to install optionhood:
1) git clone https://github.com/noahmfields/optionhood.git
2) cd optionhood
3) pip3 install .
4) You must edit the RENAME-TO-config.py file to include your Robinhood credentials
5) Rename RENAME-TO-config.py to config.py

How to start Optionhood:
1) In a shell, cd to the cloned optionhood directory (i.e., ~/optionhood)
2) ./optionhood.sh

This project was written on/for an Ubuntu 20.04 system, but could very well work just fine on OS X and Windows. The tmuxp package may not be as friendly on a non-linux system, I haven't tried it.

I run Optionhood on a DigitalOcean node to have faster access to the Robinhood API.
