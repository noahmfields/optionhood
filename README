# REQUIRES THE FOLLOWING PYTHON PACKAGES
urwid
robin_stocks
pandas
tmuxp

You will also need tmuxinator and tmuxp installed on your system.
tmuxp is a project that loads tmux yaml files to automatically create a custom tmuxinator window.

How to install optionhood:
1) git clone https://github.com/noahmfields/optionhood.git
2) cd optionhood
3) pip3 install -r requirements.txt
4) You must edit the RENAME-TO-config.py file to include your Robinhood credentials
5) Rename RENAME-TO-config.py to config.py

ON UBUNTU (probably other Debian distros as well):
1) sudo apt install tmux tmuxp


This project was written on/for an Ubuntu 20.04 system. I don't think it will work on OS X or Windows unless you can get both tmux and tmuxp installed on those systems.

I run Optionhood on a DigitalOcean node to have faster access to the Robinhood API.

I have the cheapest DO node setup for this purpose, which is more than enough resources, and then you can access it from anywhere at anytime.
