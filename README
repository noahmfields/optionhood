You will need python3 and tmux and installed on your system. Most linux distributions will have tmux in their standard, stable repositories. On OS X you can install tmux with homebrew or another package manager.

How to install optionhood:
1) git clone https://github.com/noahmfields/optionhood.git
2) cd optionhood
3) pip3 install -r requirements.txt
4) You must edit the RENAME-TO-config.py file to include your Robinhood credentials
5) After inputing your credentialis, rename RENAME-TO-config.py to config.py.


I run Optionhood on a Ubuntu DigitalOcean node to have faster access to the Robinhood API. I just SSH into the remote server, change to the optionhood directory, and run the optionhood startup script by typing:
./optionhood.sh
